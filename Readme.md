# Catch me if you Frog 🐸

## Description

\*\*

Catch me if you Frog is a game where the player will help our friend Froggy to eat as many flies as possible in a limited amount of time, as he's very hungry and very busy. The player will use the mouse to move Froggy up and down in order to collect flies. The amount of flies or points are being claculated during the game, so the player tracks his progress.The game ends when the time is up, as Froggy has a bootcamp to attend. So, he has only one minute to eat lunch before he returns to JS. It's a joyful and fun game to play.
